# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Jay Ghule, a passionate Python Full-Stack Developer who enjoys building real-world web applications and learning how modern software systems work behind the scenes. I mostly work with Django, REST APIs, and SQL databases, and I love creating applications that are both functional and easy to use.<br><br>I started my development journey with a strong interest in backend development, where I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing well-structured applications. I enjoy working on features like user authentication, CRUD operations, API integration, and database design, and I’m always curious about improving performance and scalability.<br><br>Over time, I’ve built projects such as a movie recommendation system and a habit tracking application, which helped me understand how real-world applications are planned, developed, and improved. These projects taught me how to work with third-party APIs, manage user data securely, and structure Django applications using best practices.<br><br>Along with backend development, I have a working knowledge of frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and basic React, which helps me understand the full flow of an application. I believe a good developer should understand both sides of development to build better products.<br><br>I strongly believe in continuous learning and hands-on practice. I regularly explore new tools, improve my existing projects, and learn from debugging challenges. Writing clean code, following best practices, and building meaningful applications are things I value deeply as a developer.<br><br>My goal is to grow as a professional software developer, contribute to impactful projects, and work in an environment where I can learn from experienced engineers while adding value through my skills. I’m motivated, curious, and always excited to build something new.
